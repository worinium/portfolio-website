# Personal Portfolio Website

## Description
One Day Build: Portfolio Website in VueJS and Vuetify + Invision Studio

I recently realized that I did not have a personal portfolio website so I decided to make one! This was the result of a few hours of designing and developing a website with Vuejs and Vuetify. On this page you can see some of the applications I have made and also see some of the code! If you go to https://uzirthapa.com you should be able to see the live webpage! 

The end result is what you see in this project [here](https://uzirthapa.com/)

Please check out the [YouTube Video] () as well if you would like!
